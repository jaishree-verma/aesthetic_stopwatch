# Simple Stopwatch Program

This is a simple stopwatch program that I created using CSS & JavaScript. It allows you to measure the elapsed time between starting and stopping the stopwatch.

## Features

- Start the stopwatch to begin measuring time.
- Stop the stopwatch to pause the measurement.
- Resume the stopwatch to continue measuring time.
- Reset the stopwatch to zero.

## Usage

To use the stopwatch program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Use the following commands to control the stopwatch:
    - `start` - Start the stopwatch.
    - `stop` - Stop the stopwatch.
    - `resume` - Resume the stopwatch.
    - `reset` - Reset the stopwatch to zero.
